WordGroup Documentation
=======================

Users are asked to enter words, pressing enter between each word.

To indicate they are finished, they enter an empty line (or line of whitespace only).

The program keeps count of the words that are anagrams of each other in a WordGroup object.
An instance of the WordGroup object contains all strings that are anagrams of each other,
considered case-insensitive (so "who" and "Who" are considered different words that are anagrams of each other).

The program reports the word groups in descending order of size (number of anagrams in the WordGroup).
It reports the count of words, a colon, then a space-separated list of the words.
For example:

Word groups and counts:
4: who how Who How
2: a A
