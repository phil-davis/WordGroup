WordGroup Documentation
=======================

Users are asked to enter words, pressing enter between each word.

To indicate they are finished, they enter an empty line (or line of whitespace only).

The program keeps count of the words that are anagrams of each other in a WordGroup object.
An instance of the WordGroup object contains all strings that are anagrams of each other,
considered case-insensitive (so "who" and "Who" are considered different words that are anagrams of each other).

The program reports the word groups in descending order of size (number of anagrams in the WordGroup).
It reports the count of words, a colon, then a space-separated list of the words.
For example:

Word groups and counts:
4: who how Who How
2: a A

Word entry:
- If the user enters leading or trailing space, it is ignored, only the non-whitespace is considered.
- If the user enters multiple words on the one line then only the first word is processed, the rest is ignored.
  for example "word two" - only "word" is processed.
- Any non-whitespace is considered in a word, e.g. "Question?", "!Exclamation", "Fullstop." are considered "words".
  (This could be changed if the user specified different user requirements)
